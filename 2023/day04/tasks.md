# Day 4 Task: Basic Linux Shell Scripting for DevOps Engineers.

 ## What is Kernel

 The kernel is a computer program that is the core of a computerâ€™s operating system, with complete control over everything in the system.
 
 ## What is Shell

 A shell is special user program which provide an interface to user to use operating system services. Shell accept human readable commands from user and convert them into something which kernel can understand. It is a command language interpreter that execute commands read from input devices such as keyboards or from files. The shell gets started when the user logs in or start the terminal.
 
 ## What is Linux Shell Scripting?

 A shell script is a computer program designed to be run by a linux shell, a command-line interpreter. The various dialects of shell scripts are considered to be scripting languages. Typical operations performed by shell scripts include file manipulation, program execution, and printing text.

 **Tasks**

 - Explain in your own words and examples, what is Shell Scripting for DevOps.
 - Shell scripting for DevOps refers to the process of writing and executing scripts using a shell (a command-line interface) to automate tasks in the software development and IT operations lifecycle. Shell scripts are typically written in a shell programming language like Bash, PowerShell, or Zsh.

In a DevOps context, shell scripting helps streamline and automate repetitive tasks, enhance collaboration between development and operations teams, and improve overall efficiency. Examples of shell scripting in DevOps include:

-1. Automating server provisioning: Writing a shell script to install and configure software packages, set up user accounts, and configure security settings on a new server.

-2. Continuous Integration (CI): Creating a shell script to automatically build, test, and package code whenever changes are committed to a version control system like Git.

-3. Continuous Deployment (CD): Writing a shell script to deploy the packaged code to staging or production environments, and perform post-deployment tasks like running database migrations or restarting services.

-4. Monitoring and logging: Developing shell scriptsto collect and analyze log files, monitor system performance, and generate alerts or reports on predefined conditions, helping teams proactively identify and resolve issues.

-5. Backup and recovery: Creating shell scripts to automate regular data backups, as well as restoration processes in case of data loss or system failure.

-6. Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Implementing shell scripts to define, provision, and manage infrastructure components, making it easier to maintain consistency and version control across environments.
 - What is `#!/bin/bash?` can we write `#!/bin/sh` as well?
 -#!/bin/bash` is called a shebang or hashbang line, and it is used at the beginning of a script to specify that the script should be executed using the Bash shell interpreter. This line allows the script to be run as an executable, rather than requiring the user to explicitly call the interpreter followed by the script.

 - Write a Shell Script which prints `I will complete #90DaysOofDevOps challenge`
 -  
 - Write a Shell Script to take user input, input from arguments and print the variables.
 - Write an Example of If else in Shell Scripting by comparing 2 numbers

 Was it difficult?
 
 - Post about it on LinkedIn and Let me know :)
